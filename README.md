How to Use Github: <br>
Github is a open source repository of code files meant to help large groups editing code together to work with constantly up to date files on a real time basis. This makes it possible for us all to add to the RCM as a community of modders bringing our races together. We can always have the latest version with any new additions made by out talented Starbound modders. If you can edit JSON coding files on your computer, it's as simple as looking through your folders and finding the proper file. Luckily in this case, we only have a few JSON files to deal with making it that much easier.<br>
<br>
If you are looking to edit the main villager dialogue for your race, simply open the villager.npc file and edit like you would normally in notepad++. Keep in mind that others will be basing their codes off the current branch, so a bit of courtesy goes a long way.
<br>
-Keep the coding in proper format. Simply making sure your code lines up properly with the rest of the code makes it much easier to read, edit, and find errors.<br>
-Use spaces, not tabs. This isn't important in JSON coding but is in many other codings. Many coders do this innately without thinking, as other coding languages require spaces as oppossed to tabs. Formating can go out of whack when a combination of tabs and spaces are used sometimes, so to make things easier simply use spaces instead of tabs.<br>
-Always run your coding through a JSON parser (JSONlint.com for example) to make sure you have no coding errors.<br>
-It's ok if you mess up a bit, the edits will be reviewed and fixed before they are committed to the main branch.<br>
<br>
Once you are finished editing save your branch, then request a pull to the main branch for update. It will be reviewed and committed to keep the main branch up-to-date in as timely a fashion as possible.
